# Unified 5-Layer Architecture & Technology Standard

## Goal
Consolidate architectural rules and technology standards into a single, authoritative document.

## Execution Steps

1.  **Create New File**: `c:\Users\kbsim\Desktop\Trae\Ez4u\docs\user_docs\Unified_5_Layer_Architecture.md`
2.  **Content Structure (Layer by Layer 1-5)**:
    *   **Layer Header**: Name + Agent.
    *   **Responsibilities**: extracted from `5-LayerArchitecture.md`.
    *   **Tech Stack Tables**: extracted from `5-LayerArchitectureTechnology.md` (Core, UI, State, etc.).
    *   **Strict Protocols**: Merged "MUST DO/NOT DO" lists (keeping the strict behavioral rules from Arch file and tech constraints from Tech file).
3.  **Append Global Standards**:
    *   **Communication Matrix**: The detailed interaction rules and ASCII diagrams.
    *   **Scenarios**: detailed data flow examples.
    *   **Package Definitions**: `package.json` and `requirements.txt`.
4.  **Validation**: Ensure no rules are lost during the merge (e.g., RLS policies, specific package versions).
5.  **Final Output**: A markdown file ready for agent use.

# Create Planner Evolution Rule

I will create a dedicated rule file to enforce the "Evolutionary Planning" strategy. This ensures that the **Architect Planner** (and any other agent involved in planning) always respects the existing plan structure and only makes additive or minor adjustments.

## 📂 New Rule File
**Path:** `.trae/rules/planner-evolution-rules.md`

## 📝 Rule Content
```markdown
# Planner Evolution Rules

## ✅ MUST DO
1. **Inherit Context**: Always read the existing plan (if any) before generating a new one.
2. **Evolution over Revolution**:
    *   **Expand**: Add granularity to existing steps (e.g., break "Build Login" into "UI", "API", "Auth").
    *   **Refine**: Clarify descriptions or add technical references.
    *   **Adjust**: specific errors or outdated steps.
3. **Preserve Structure**: Maintain the high-level Phases (Foundation -> Core Logic -> Interface) unless architectural requirements fundamentally change.
4. **Traceability**: Link new detailed tasks back to their parent items in the General Plan.

## ❌ PROHIBITED
1. **Total Rewrites**: Do not discard the existing plan to create a "better" one from scratch.
2. **Context Amnesia**: Do not ignore previously completed or in-progress steps.
3. **Scope Creep**: Do not add phases or major goals unrelated to the original General Plan without explicit user confirmation.
```

## 🛠️ Implementation Steps
1.  Create `.trae/rules/planner-evolution-rules.md` with the content above.
2.  (Optional) Reference this new rule in `architect-planner/SKILL.md` to ensure the agent knows to look for it.

**Shall I proceed with creating this rule file?**

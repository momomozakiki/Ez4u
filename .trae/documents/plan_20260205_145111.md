# Create Architect Planner Skill

## Goal
Create a sophisticated `architect-planner` skill that generates detailed, atomic, checkbox-based execution plans tailored to the 5-Layer Architecture.

## Execution Steps

1.  **Invoke `Skill` tool** with `name: "skill-creator"`.
2.  **In the skill creation prompt**:
    *   **Name**: `architect-planner`
    *   **Description**: "Breaks down complex features into atomic, layer-specific tasks with checkboxes."
    *   **Instructions**:
        1.  Analyze the user request.
        2.  **MANDATORY**: Read `package.json` and `requirements.txt` to confirm stack versions.
        3.  Read `Unified_5_Layer_Architecture.md` to identify affected layers.
        4.  Generate a **Markdown Checklist** where every item:
            *   Is atomic (doable in 1 step).
            *   Is assigned to a specific Agent (e.g., `[Frontend-Agent]`).
            *   Includes file paths.
            *   Starts unchecked (`- [ ]`).

## Validation
*   Verify the skill can be triggered by "Plan this feature" or "Break down this task".
*   Confirm the output format matches the checklist requirement.

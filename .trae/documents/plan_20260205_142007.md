# Consolidate Anti-Hallucination Rules

## Goal
Merge `anti-hallucination-general-rules.md` into `anti-hallucination-rules.md` to create a single, high-performance rule file (<1000 chars).

## Execution Steps

1.  **Update `anti-hallucination-rules.md`**:
    *   **Description**: Update to "Universal rules to prevent factual and technical hallucinations."
    *   **MUST DO Section**:
        1.  Verify language/framework versions BEFORE answering (Technical)
        2.  Declare knowledge cutoff date for time-sensitive queries (Factual)
        3.  Ground answers ONLY in verified context (Universal)
        4.  Cite sources/docs for all claims (Universal)
        5.  Abstain when uncertain ("I cannot verify") (Universal)
        6.  Use Output Format: `[Verified: source]` | `[Cutoff: YYYY-MM]`
    *   **PROHIBITED Section**:
        1.  Fabricating APIs, events, or statistics
        2.  Assuming "latest version" or post-cutoff details
        3.  Confident answers about undocumented features
        4.  Speculation presented as fact
2.  **Delete `anti-hallucination-general-rules.md`**: Remove the redundant file.

## Validation
*   Check file size is <1000 characters.
*   Verify all critical constraints from both original files are preserved.

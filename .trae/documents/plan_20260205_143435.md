# Confirm Rule Configuration

## Goal
Acknowledge the user's correct understanding that reference links are unnecessary due to pre-loading, and confirm the current rule file count is optimal.

## Execution Steps
1.  **No Action Required**: The current rule files are correctly configured, pre-loaded, and well within system limits (6 files vs practical limit of ~10-15).
2.  **Final Response**: Confirm that no file edits are needed and the current architecture is efficient.

# Plan: Install Dependencies & Refine Architecture Standard

I will align your project with the 5-Layer Architecture by installing the missing required packages and then updating the `architect-planner` skill to focus on **Technology Purpose** rather than specific versions.

## Phase 1: Install Missing Architectural Components

I will install the packages identified as missing in the previous review to ensure full compliance with the 5-Layer Architecture.

### 1. Frontend (Layer 1 & 2)
**Command:** `pnpm add zustand @tanstack/react-query react-hook-form zod axios next-rate-limit`
*   **Reasons:**
    *   `zustand`: Client state (required).
    *   `react-query`: Server state caching (required).
    *   `react-hook-form` + `zod`: Robust form validation.
    *   `axios`: Standard HTTP client.
    *   `next-rate-limit`: BFF API protection.

### 2. Backend (Layer 3, 4 & 5)
**Command:** `pip install prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator opentelemetry-api opentelemetry-sdk pybreaker uuid7`
*   **Reasons:**
    *   `prometheus` + `opentelemetry`: Observability (Layer 3).
    *   `pybreaker`: Circuit Breaker for stability (Layer 4).
    *   `uuid7`: Database primary key standard (Layer 5).

## Phase 2: Refine `SKILL.md` (Purpose-Driven)

I will **NOT** delete the architecture definition. Instead, I will **improve** it to be a timeless "Technology Standard":

1.  **Remove Raw Manifests**: Delete the redundant `## 📦 Reference Package Definitions` section (the raw JSON/TXT blocks).
2.  **Update Technology Tables**:
    *   **Remove** the specific "Version" column (e.g., `^16.1.6`).
    *   **Keep** the **Package Name**, **Purpose**, and **Alignment** columns.
    *   **Add** a clear instruction: *"Refer to `package.json` and `requirements.txt` for the active version. Ensure new packages are added to this list with their architectural purpose."*

**Outcome:**
Your project will have all required libraries installed, and the `architect-planner` skill will serve as a guide for *why* we use specific tools, without getting outdated by version bumps.

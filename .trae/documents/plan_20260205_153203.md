# Reorganize Architect Planner Skill

I will restructure the `architect-planner` skill to strictly follow the **Trae Skill Standard** (`Skill_Structure.md` & `Skill_Md_File_Format.md`). This involves separating the reference material from the core instructions.

## 📂 New Structure
```
.trae/skills/architect-planner/
├── SKILL.md                            # Streamlined instructions
└── resources/
    └── unified_architecture.md         # Extracted 5-Layer Architecture Standard
```

## 🛠️ Implementation Steps

### 1. Extract Architecture Standard
I will move the **Unified 5-Layer Architecture & Technology Standard** section (currently embedded in `SKILL.md`) into a new file:
`resources/unified_architecture.md`

### 2. Rewrite `SKILL.md`
I will update `SKILL.md` to match the official format:
*   **YAML Frontmatter**: `name`, `description`.
*   **## Description**: Concise summary of the agent's role.
*   **## When to use**: Clear triggers (e.g., "planning features", "breaking down tasks").
*   **## Instructions**:
    *   Step 1: Read `resources/unified_architecture.md`.
    *   Step 2: Read `package.json` / `requirements.txt`.
    *   Step 3: Generate the Atomic Plan.

## Benefit
This separation makes the **Skill Definition** clean and compliant with Trae standards, while keeping the **Architecture Reference** modular and easy to update without cluttering the agent's instruction file.

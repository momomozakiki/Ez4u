# Project Rules: Guidance Categorization (Alias)

- Defer categorization mechanics to the core rule: [trae-rule-of-rules-and-skills.md](file:///c:/Users/kbsim/Desktop/Trae/Ez4u/.trae/rules/trae-rule-of-rules-and-skills.md).
- Defer hallucination checks to the core rule: [anti-hallucination-rules.md](file:///c:/Users/kbsim/Desktop/Trae/Ez4u/.trae/rules/anti-hallucination-rules.md).
- Enforce placement only:
  - Constraints → `.trae/rules/` (imperative language).
  - Patterns/examples/workflows → `.trae/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` (descriptive).
- Do not duplicate constraints already defined in core rules.
- This file exists solely to route to core rules and avoid duplication.
